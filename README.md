 ## Navbar and Home Page :-

- Navbar has an icon which revolves when hovered on.
- In the first few seconds, the links are not visible and if user clicks on the icon then it will perform an animation and then the links will become visible. And if for around two seconds, the icon is not clicked, the animation will be triggered by itself.
- Home page has an GIF in the center which when clicked will start an animation and end it when its clicked again.
